abstract: Abstract—Despite the recent success in data-driven fault diagnosis of rotating machines, there are still remaining challenges in this field. Among the issues to be addressed, is the lack of information about variety of faults the system may encounter in the field. In this paper, we assume a partial knowledge of the system faults and use the corresponding data to train a convolutional neural network. A combination of t-SNE method and clustering techniques is then employed to detect novel faults. Upon detection, the network is augmented using the new data. Finally, a test setup is used to validate this two-stage methodology on a centrifugal pump and experimental results show high accuracy in detecting novel faults. Index Terms—centrifugal pump, condition monitoring, classification, convolutional neural network, t-SNE, clustering.
