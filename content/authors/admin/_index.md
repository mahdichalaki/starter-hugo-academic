I am currently an MSc student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Alberta, specializing in medical robotics and rehabilitation.\
\
My research is focused on developing a smart walker that combines a wheeled mobile robot with a manipulator, aiming to restore functional walking ability for individuals in need. With a strong passion for autonomous systems and human-robot interaction, my ultimate goal is to contribute to advancements in assistive technology and make a meaningful impact on enhancing mobility and quality of life.
